          My name is Victor Oderinde, a graduate of Mathematics, with keen interest for IT. My
          interest grew right from a tender age been attracted to devices and curious to know how it
          works and what can be achieved with it. I started operating computer before age 9,
          learning how to perform basic tasks on my own. With the help of my basic class computer
          studies text, I was able to get myself with doing stuffs and I keep on growing my
          knowledge from there.

          I joined AltSchool School of Engineering, Cloud Computing track to be a DevOps and Cloud
          in the nearest future. This is a journey of months if not years, but yeah, I am ready for
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal at the end of this program is to have gain solid theoretical knowledge as well as
          hands-on experience worthwhile to get an entry role in the field. In addition to it, I am
          looking to bag as much relevant certifications as I could before the end of the 12 months
          journey.
